Analyzed The [TMDb movie data set]("https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv") cleaned from [original data on Kaggle]("https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata") using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier and then communicated the findings about it.

## Steps Followed
- Downloaded the [TMDb data set](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv) and chose to do analysis using Jupyter notebook.
- Data was cleaned for missing data, inappropriate data, etc. using NumPy and pandas.
- Analyzed the data. Brainstormed some questions by looking at the data set to answer them in the process using visualizations.
- Communicated the findings and limitations from the analysis.
